    "ANS - When declaring variables in Python, it is important to follow certain conventions and naming rules. Here are the conventions and rules typically followed:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable Names:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable names should start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).\n",
    "They can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.\n",
    "Variable names are case-sensitive, so \"myVariable\" and \"myvariable\" would be treated as different variables.\n",
    "Naming Style Conventions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use descriptive variable names that indicate the purpose of the variable.\n",
    "Use lowercase letters for variable names, and separate words within a name using underscores (snake_case). For example, my_variable_name.\n",
    "Avoid Using Reserved Words:\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not use Python's reserved words (keywords) as variable names. These are words like if, else, for, while, etc., which have special meanings in Python.\n",
    "Constants:\n",
    "\n",
    "Constants are usually named with all uppercase letters and underscores separating words (UPPER_CASE). For example, PI = 3.14159.\n",
    "Private Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "By convention, if you want to indicate that a variable is intended to be private (not to be accessed from outside the class or module), you can prefix it with a single underscore. For example, _private_variable.\n",
    "Class Names:\n",
    "\n",
    "Class names should follow the CapWords convention, also known as PascalCase, where each word in the name begins with a capital letter, and there are no underscores. For example, MyClass.\n",
    "Module Names:\n",
    "\n",
    "Module names should be lowercase and can contain underscores. For example, my_module.py.\n",
    "Avoid Ambiguous Names:\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid using single-letter variable names or very short names (unless they represent a well-known convention, like i for an index in a loop).\n",
    "PEP 8:\n",
    "\n",
    "PEP 8 is the Python Enhancement Proposal that provides coding style guidelines for Python. It's a good idea to follow PEP 8 recommendations for variable naming and coding style in general.\n",
    "Remember that adhering to these conventions makes your code more readable and understandable for you and other programmers who may work on your code in the future."
